## Overview
The github page contains the 16s rRNA sequencing data that are used in our paper <br/>
What Can We Learn about the Bias of Microbiome Studies from Analyzing Data from Mock Communities? Li, M., Tyx, R.E., Rivera, A.J., Zhao, N., Satten, G.A., *Genes*, In press  <br/>

## Details
This data table comes from 3 different types of samples: the Zymo standard comprising cells (ZMC); the Zymo cell standard mixed with a biological matrix (ZMC + Matrix); and samples comprising commercially available smokeless tobacco products. Each samples was analyzed using the four different DNA extraction protocols, Base, Enzymes, Lifeguard and RNAProtect. 

The data table contains 105 rows and 88 columns (row names and column names are counted), and mainly consists of two parts. The first part from column 2-79 contains the OTU reads counts of 78 taxa detected by a customized R pipeline and the second part from column 80-88 contains the related metadata information for all 104 samples.
